To run RoboBlast:

1. Locate the folder RoboBlast, which should have in it files named
RoboBlast and Assets.  It's likely that the path to the folder will be
/Users/yourname/RoboBlast or /Users/yourname/Downloads/RoboBlast.

2. Open a Terminal window and type
	cd whateverThePathIs
where you should replace whateverThePathIs with the path to the RoboBlast
folder.

3. Confirm you're in the right folder by typing
	ls
which should show you the Assets folder and the RoboBlast executable.

4. Type
	./RoboBlast
to play the game.  Use the arrow keys to move and the space bar to shoot.
You can type q to quit the game prematurely.

Alternatively, in the folder RoboBlast, you can move the Assets folder
to your home directory, then double-click on the RoboBlast executable
file.
